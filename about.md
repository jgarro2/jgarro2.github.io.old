My  name is Jorge Garro. I'm a guy from Costa Rica, interested in creating solutions by making use of Information Technologies and Arts. I'm a family man. My wife, my daughter and my son drive my motivation towards making this world a better place.

I'm an IT professional in constant development, of highly critical and analytic mindset. I enjoy and find immense value in everyday learning opportunities. I'm very passionate about designing and creating solutions.

So, I have decided to start this blog to share some of me.

Thanks for stepping by.
